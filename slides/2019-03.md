Notes:
- I am not interested in politics (but politics is intersted in you)
- It is easier to help something to stay as is, than to fight for it
- Freedom is not something that is obvious and given.
- Freedom of panorama / Wolność panoramy
- miasta chcą chronić swój wizerunek... i również zakazać fotografii
- media? media actually want this regulations to be introduced, so that's why silence
